Project Idea

Overview

I would like to create a gardening app specifically for the Australian landscape called Native. It would tell you what native plants you can find/plant in your area. It would include seasonal options, information on each plant such as ideal soil type, sun exposure and watering, and uses; medicinal, edible, etc. I’d also have information on whether the plant attracts local insects, birds or fauna.Lastly I’d like to include gardening tips and tricks which could be for specific plants, permaculture or even general areas such as lawns. The app could be user generated as well and people could add their own entries.

Motivation

I am all about education, and I love the environment, so I think this app would be timely since there is a growing interest in native flora and fauna in Australia. In the 2020 trend report by Gardening Australia, they found that there “was a rise in ‘cultivated wildness’...Australian natives were used extensively” in displays at garden shows. (https://www.gardeningaustralia.com.au/trend-report/)  A lot of native flora is also edible, but is rarely used in cooking so it would be a great way to build awareness. As we also enter into an extreme stage of climate change, people also want to be able to have gardens that are sustainable, and want to be able to grow their own food. According to My Plant Life Balance, their 2020 survey shows that 3 in 4 Australians tend to backyard plants, with 1 in 4 buying a native plant in the last year (https://myplantlifebalance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PLB_Trend_Report_2020.pdf).
