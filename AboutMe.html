<p class="Helvetica">
Iâ€™m Melbourne born, but of Indian descent. I speak English mainly, but can understand Hindi and Punjabi.
I have completed two degrees, one in Journalism and one in Visual art and Design. I have also completed a CELTA cert which I did with RMIT, which has allowed me to teach English as a vocation for the last 3 years.
My favorite things to do when I have free time are, spending time with my dogs, creating art, yoga, gardening and cooking.
You might find it interesting to know that I was a dancer as a child. I practiced tap, jazz, ballet and hip hop for ten years.

My interest in IT lies mostly in coding and the ability to problem solve and be creative  using technology. I started to get interested in these things when I was a teenager. I used to manipulate the code on my myspace profile. Seems basic, but it sparked a lot of experimentation and self-exploration into different digital avenues. As of today, I have around 7 months of experience working for a small digital startup in Melbourne where I worked on  copywriting and SEO, digital marketing, data analysis, and web development.</p>

I chose to come to RMIT because of my past experience studying with the University. I found the lecturers knowledgeable and experienced, and the feedback really helped me improve my work. I also made great connections and even worked at RMIT for a few months in their English language school for International students.

In my current course I expect to come out with an understanding of a range of IT related skills and be able to apply my knowledge in a real world setting. I also hope to find the right field to enter according to my skills and personal interests.
