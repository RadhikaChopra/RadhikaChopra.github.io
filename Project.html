<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>I would like to create a gardening app specifically for the Australian landscape called Native. It would tell you what native plants you can find/plant in your area. It would include seasonal options, information on each plant such as ideal soil type, sun exposure and watering, and uses; medicinal, edible, etc. I’d also have information on whether the plant attracts local insects, birds or fauna.Lastly I’d like to include gardening tips and tricks which could be for specific plants, permaculture or even general areas such as lawns. The app could be user generated as well and people could add their own entries.
</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
I am all about education, and I love the environment, so I think this app would be timely since there is a growing interest in native flora and fauna in Australia. In a recent report it was found that there “was a rise in ‘cultivated wildness’...Australian natives were used extensively” in displays at garden shows (Trend Report, 2020).<br>
According to My Plant Life Balance, their 2020 survey shows that 3 in 4 Australians tend to backyard plants, with 1 in 4 buying a native plant in the last year (Trend report - 2020 predictions, 2020).
Unlike a lot of other places, most of what we eat in Australia comes from other places, however a lot our natives are edible and could form an important part of our diet. “There are a range of underutilised tubers, grains, nuts and fruits that could be developed as crops” and as we enter into an extreme stage of climate change, this knowledge could be the catalyst to a more sustainable food system in our country (Lowe, 2019).

</p>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
What the app would do:<br><br>
<strong>1.</strong> List of flora<br><br>
It would allow you to discover what native flora you can find or plant in your area. By utilising an interactive map of Australia, a user would enter their location data, date and time information, for seasonal varieties and planting times, as well as any additional personal preferences such as flowers, trees, or edible plants. The app would then be able to provide appropriate recommendations for the specified area.
<br><br>
<strong>2.</strong>Database of Plants<br><br>
It would be based on a database of flora, which would include key information about each entry, functioning as a profile for the plant.<br>
As a user you would be able to save your favorites. <br>Profiles would include the following information amongst others:<br><br>
Season → Whether it would be best to plant in summer/winter/autumn/spring, it’s life expectancy (bi-annual, annual or perennial), whether it can be potted, and it’s bloom times.<br><br>
Ideal soil type → This would be determined by location, as each state has its own native types, and there is a difference between inland, forest, and coastal planting.<br><br>
Sun exposure → It would tell you whether the plant needs full sun, partial, or shade.<br><br>
Watering → Some plants require frequent watering, whereas others are happier with drier soil and would drown if overwatered. The app would tell you the ideal moisture for each plant and give you a watering schedule.<br><br>
Uses → This would allow you to work out whether a plant could be grown and cut for a specific purpose. For example medicinal, edible, decorative, etc.<br><br>
Information on what native fauna or insects the plant would attract → This would be an important aspect to include as it is a major factor in creating a more sustainable overall ecosystem. Planting more native flora means more flowers for native bees and birds to pollinate, and more biodiversity in insect populations.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.</strong> User profiles<br><br>
Each user would have their own profile where they could access and share their likes and favorites. They could save plant profiles and gardening tips, and follow people and projects. They would be able to post their own content and comment on others.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Gardening tips<br><br>
Lastly there would be a section for gardening tips and tricks. This would encompass topics such as permaculture, information for specific plants, setting up a veggie garden, and even general lawn care. I would like this section to be user populated, so people can be seen as experts and add their own entries. These entries could be accessed by others, and liked to create what I envision as “plant influencers”.
</p>

<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
<p><strong>Some suggestions:</strong><br><br>
<u>Hardware</u><br>
The app would be aimed for an iOS or android device.<br><br>
<u>Coding languages</u><br>
For iOS, swift playgrounds or for Android, Java.<br><br>
<u>Software</u><br>
An open source choice could be Ionic, as it offers a lot of funcionality, UI considerations, it's customizable and there is a huge community of developers for support. <br>
Another consideration could be Buildfire. Once again it's open-source, and it offers a lot of custom features, UI, an easy to learn platform, and it can scale.<br>
(12 Best Free and Open Source Mobile App Development Software, 2020)<br><br>
<u>Other possibilities</u><br>
Possible user location data to help mapping of suitable plant areas.<br>
Open source database for plant information<br>
</p>
<h1>Skills Required</h1>
<p><strong>Some of the skills that may be required are:</strong><br><br>
User Experience design<br>
Swift or Java language<br>
Writing<br>
Photography<br>
Design<br><br>
Most of these skills are accessible except for the programming languages and the UX which are specialised skills, that an expert may have to provide.<br>
</p>

<h1>Outcome</h1>

<p>If this project is successful, the outcome would be an increase in awareness and use of native flora, and the creation of a like-minded community working towards sustainability.<br> It would allow for more native plantings in backyards, helping with the problem of food scarcity, as well as increasing overall biodiversity in Australia.
