About  me:

Iâ€™m Melbourne born, but of Indian descent. I speak English mainly, but can understand Hindi and Punjabi.
I have completed two degrees, one in Journalism and one in Visual art and Design. I have also completed a CELTA cert which I did with RMIT, which has allowed me to teach English as a vocation for the last 3 years.
My favorite things to do when I have free time are, spending time with my dogs, creating art, yoga, gardening and cooking.
You might find it interesting to know that I was a dancer as a child. I practiced tap, jazz, ballet and hip hop for ten years.
</p>
<p class="sansserif">
My interest in IT lies mostly in coding and the ability to problem solve and be creative  using technology. I started to get interested in these things when I was a teenager. I used to manipulate the code on my myspace profile. Seems basic, but it sparked a lot of experimentation and self-exploration into different digital avenues. As of today, I have around 7 months of experience working for a small digital startup in Melbourne where I worked on  copywriting and SEO, digital marketing, data analysis, and web development.</p>
<p class="sansserif">
I chose to come to RMIT because of my past experience studying with the University. I found the lecturers knowledgeable and experienced, and the feedback really helped me improve my work. I also made great connections and even worked at RMIT for a few months in their English language school for International students.
</p>
<p class="sansserif">
In my current course I expect to come out with an understanding of a range of IT related skills and be able to apply my knowledge in a real world setting. I also hope to find the right field to enter according to my skills and personal interests.

<h5>My ideal job: Learning Designer</h5>
</p><p>
The position:

The position is for a learning designer. Someone who can help build online courses for universities using best practice in coding, and knowledge of teaching pedagogy and curriculum building.
This is appealing to me as I am a teacher at the moment and I love being in the classroom, but I would like the opportunity to work on developing resources and online material. The position would allow me to put my love of education together with my interest in coding and design.
</p><p>
Skills and qualifications:
For this job the main skills would be knowing how to code in various languages used in learning management systems, knowledge of design principles with attention to detail, and an idea of University style education. You would also need strong communication skills, ability to work in a team, and deal with clients. You would possibly need a qualification as a teacher (VIT) or  TAE certificate. You may or may not require a qualification in IT or design.
</p><p>
My current skills:
I have two degrees (Journalism and Visual Art) and have completed a CELTA certificate, which allows me to teach English as a second language. I have worked within private institutes, University and TAFE settings as an ELICOS/EAP teacher for the past three years. I have experience building curriculums for courses both in the classroom and online. I am familiar with learning management systems such as Moodle and Canvas, and have used them in both a student and teacher capacity. I have past experience in coding in HTML and CSS from my degrees and jobs, as well as my own personal projects. I also have a strong personal interest in education and technology.
</p><p>
My plan:
My plan is to finish my course in Information technology, and build on my coding skills in my own time. I will then apply for junior positions or internships to get hands-on experience in the role. I will also apply through my current employer and see if I can gain some training with our learning design team as part of my professional development.
